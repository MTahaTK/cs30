v0.11
    - Equation now implemented; user can provide program with a string in
    mathematical syntax (separated by operators) and converts into
    equation for Python to use
    - Multiplication must use * operator
    - Returns evaluation of equation with an x value of 3
2019/06/05
v0.2
    - Graphing function implemented into graphing_calculator.py: allows user to provide an algebraic equation string through Equation and graphs the function with set bounds.
    - Evaluation function added to caculator_base.py, however not currently implemented
    - Bugfixes regarding old calculator functions
2019/06/06
v0.3 ALPHA TESTING
    - Alpha testing found some errors in old calculator code, were subsequently fixed.
